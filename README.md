# Project-2_Divide-and-Conquer-Greedy-Problems_Isha-Paliwal
The Divide and conquer algorithm to compute a staircase of a set of points, P.

# Problem Statement

(“Staircase / Pareto-optimal points”) Let P be a set of n points in a 2-dimensional plane. A point p ϵ P is Pareto-optimal if no other point is both above and to the right of p. The sorted sequence of Pareto-optimal points describes a top-right staircase with the interior points of P below and to the left of the staircase. We want to compute this staircase. 

Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O (n log n) time.
